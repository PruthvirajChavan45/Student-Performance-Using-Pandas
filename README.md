# 📊 Student Performance Analysis Using Pandas

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student academic performance using the Pandas library in Python.  
It is designed to reflect real-world, large-scale data analysis workflows with a focus on efficiency, scalability, and meaningful insight generation.

The complete analysis was performed on a **large dataset containing over 1,000,000+ rows**.  
For GitHub compatibility and ease of access, only a smaller sample of the dataset is included in this repository.

## 📊 Dataset Information

### Original Dataset
- Size: **1,000,000+ rows**
- Used for full-scale analysis and performance testing
- Not uploaded due to GitHub size and performance limitations

### Sample Dataset (Included)
- File: `student_performance_sample.csv`
- Maintains the same structure and schema as the full dataset
- Used to demonstrate all Pandas operations in the notebook

> All analysis steps, logic, and conclusions shown in the notebook scale directly to the full dataset without any modification.
